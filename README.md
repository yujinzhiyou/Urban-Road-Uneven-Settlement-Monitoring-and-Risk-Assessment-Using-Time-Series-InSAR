# Urban-Road-Uneven-Settlement-Monitoring-and-Risk-Assessment-Using-Time-Series-InSAR
With the accelerated urbanization process in China, the rapid development of urban infrastructure has made uneven road settlement an important issue affecting road safety. Currently, traditional geodetic methods face problems such as high labor costs and long time consumption, which necessitate the development of an efficient, accurate, and scalable monitoring method. Therefore, this paper proposes a monitoring and risk assessment method for uneven road settlement based on time-series InSAR technology, aiming to improve monitoring range and efficiency.
